/*
    Basically should be an Observable that provides the EOS history in discrete events.

    As well as functions to get distinct blocks.

    Detect which of the BPs have the history
    Which of the backup ones do

    Could start with providers' info, including latencies.

    // Then from each of them, take a sample of different history blocks.

    // Can work backwards or forwards.
    //  Compiling history blocks from full nodes would be useful.

    //   eg 0 to 1024
